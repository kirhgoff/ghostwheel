Attempt to create Rust based entity key/value storage with DSL

## Usecases
- I can describe my domain objects system with their dependencies (calculatable fields) on DSL-like Rust code
- I can start storage with my schema store and get objects from it by the key
- I can query the storage with SQL-like language (or any other linq)

## Prototype 1
